One hiccup that i had when i was completeing my map was that when i went to work on the project in the lab someone was using the computer. I was able to use the drive that works across all of the computers and after I moved them i was able to acess them on a diuffernt compouter in the romm. Over all I didn't think it was too bad because I had to utilize these drives in a class freshman year, so once i refreshed myself i had a smooth exsperiance.\n",

        "    - Overall, i really liked using ARC GIS pro and thought that it was very streight forward and user friendly. I am very familiar with the microsoft apps, and a lot of the functions are in similar tabs. Once i got an idea of where to look for a tool, i was able to go through the exercise quickly."
