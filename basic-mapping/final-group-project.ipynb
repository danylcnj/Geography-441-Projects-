        "This report concluded that multiple variables influence changes in Ohio. Our report focus specifically on variables such as income, age, school enrollment, and housing vacancy. Overall, the greatest percent increases in population were found in counties within and adjacent to metropolitan cities and college towns within Ohio (Fig. 1) This pattern corresponds with trends in housing vacancy, as rural counties saw the highest percent increase in vacancy, whereas major cities saw the lowest percent increase in vacancy. (Fig. 4) Minimal changes were seen in median age. However, a majority of counties saw an increase in age. This was supported by our age density map (Fig. 5) with all individuals ages 20 - 24 also showing an increase in population. (Fig. 2) All counties saw an increase in income, showcasing an increase in economic growth across the state. (Fig. 3) Through visualizing different demographic changes, we were able to analyze the impacts of these potential drivers on changes from 2013 - 2023 in Ohio population."

        "Throughout the decade, Ohio has undergone significant changes in population, driven by several influencing factors. These changes can be quantified through further exploring the impact of demographic trends on the state's population. In our final project, various elements were examined to explain patterns of population growth or decline in the state. These elements include income, age, school enrollment, and housing vacancy, with data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau to aid in answering our central research question: Which demographics are potential drivers for change in Ohio Populations from 2013 - 2023? By analyzing these datasets, we are able to understand not only where change is happening in Ohio, but also why these shifts may be occurring.\n",

The introductory map titled *\"Percent Change in Population by Ohio Counties: 2013 - 2023\"* created by Emmalyn Nye (Figure 1) serves as a spatial reference point for the rest of the project. This map highlights several counties with significant growth or decline in population across a ten year span, calculated using a percent change metric, then visualized using a diverging color scheme with red showing decline and green showing growth. The map illustrates a prominent population increase within counties surrounding major, metropolitan cities such as Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. Using this map as the guide for the remainder of our project, we are able to make a further inquiry into the potential drivers behind these patterns.\n"

        "When examining the data for median age change by county in Ohio, the general trend is an increase in median age. This is clear because the majority of the map is made of counties assigned warmer colors (yellow, orange, red) which indicate an increase.  The counties that showed the greatest increase in median age (3-4 years) were Ottawa and Vinton counties. Ottawa county is known to have a high quality of life and several houses on the lake. This increase in median age indicates that most people likely did not leave this area to move elsewhere in Ohio between 2013 and 2023, because of this counties' supposed benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, counties that decreased in median age over the time period were Coshocton, Richland, Hamilton, Mercer and Montgomery.  Coshocton and Richland county both have very high Amish populations. In Amish culture, it is common to get married and have children early. If many of the Amish in these counties had children over the time period, it may be a factor in the decrease of the median age we see in the data. Hamilton and Montgomery counties are home to Cincinnati and Dayton, respectively. Both of these cities may have had an influx of young people moving for work post-college.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, there was minimal changes in median age, but the majority of counties increased. The entire range was between -0.4 years (~5months) to +4 years. This overall slight increase is likely due to a balance in birth and death rates, as well as a large proportion of Ohio residents staying in their counties over the time period.\n",

        "When modeling percentage median household income change from 2013 to 2023, we could visualize some interesting findings when creating this dataset map. For every  county in Ohio from 2013 to 2023, a percentage increase in the median household income was seen with no counties experiencing a median household income percentage decrease. Specifically, the county that increased the least was Pike County at a 17.52% increase in income. The counties that experienced the greatest percentage increases were Union County (68.25%), Holmes County (64.42%), Wyandot County (61.71%), Jackson County (60.66%), and Henry County (60.33%). While every county in Ohio experienced a percentage increase in income, there was no apparent overall trend for the scale at which certain counties were experiencing the most percentage change. One theory we had was that these counties could be experiencing the most overall economic growth in the state, which would need to be researched more to determine accuracy of this claim. There was also uncertainty with this dataset mapping as the identification of pattern connections between this map and other maps completed was difficult to determine. This could be limited by the 10-year time span of the datasets, where many variables can change and impact income, but the overall finding of this map was the positive percentage increase in median household income for all counties in Ohio from 2013-2023.\n",

        "For this map I modled the percent of students who were enrolled in highschool in the years 2013 and in 2023 in each ohio county. I then found the percent change between 2013 and 2023 by county and showed the change by county on my map. This allowed me to visulize my findings and see how the highscool in the enrollment has changed around the state. I was supprised to find that there was a widespread decrese in the population of students enrolled state wide. Some of the paterns that I was able to identify in the state was that some of the counties that saw a large drop in the nuber of students enrolled bordered counties that saw a large rise in enrollment which could signify patterns of where people with families are moving in the state. I also was able to identify that columbus was the only major metropolotan area in ohio that saw a large enrollment increse in the state. Some of the notable changes throughout the state were Union County at +25.37%, Delaware County at +42.92%, Morrow County at -25.28%, and Vinton County at -35.12%. Union and Delaware, the two counties with highest increses in enrollment in the state, were in the vicinity of Morrow county which saw the second largest decrese in the state. These three counties are all in the Columbus metro area, and signifys a large population of families moving to the north east region in Columbus. This did also have a corelation with other maps as well. The areas around Columbus that saw a large increse in enrollment also saw a significant increse in household income."

        "Altogether, we were able to visualize changes in the Ohio population from several perspectives, giving us insight into the way variables of change can impact and support one another.  We found the strongest decrease in overall population along the southeast edge of the state.  This coincides with the trends observed in our housing vacancy map (Fig. 4).  Southeastern Ohio, which saw a decrease in population also saw an increase in housing vacancy. There were notable increases in population in the counties that are home to major metropolitan areas, like Columbus, Cincinnati and Cleveland (Fig. 1). These areas are the most capable of supporting an increase in population, as housing is available in high rises, supporting larger numbers of people in a smaller space. Median age decreased in these areas, suggesting an increase in young people moving to these cities (Fig. 2). This was further detailed by the Age Density Map, which showed a large increase in people aged 20-24 living in these metropolitan areas (Fig. 5). Lastly, our income map showed that all counties increased in median income by household, which displayed increasing economic growth in Ohio (Fig. 3). Looking at population changes through several lenses allowed us to find connections between observed changes, and draw conclusions about the state of Ohio between 2013 and 2023."
